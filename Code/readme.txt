# Embedded Software Project

## Overview

This project utilizes STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE to develop embedded software for STM32 microcontrollers. 
STM32CubeMX is a powerful tool provided by STMicroelectronics that facilitates configuration of STM32 microcontrollers and generates initialization code 
for various peripherals. This README provides an overview of how the code is structured and generated using these tools.

## Project Setup

### STM32CubeMX Configuration

1. **Creating the Project**: Open STM32CubeMX and create a new project. Select the appropriate STM32 microcontroller or development board for your application.

2. **Peripheral Configuration**: Configure the microcontroller peripherals (e.g., GPIO, timers, USART, ADC) as per the requirements of your project. 
STM32CubeMX provides a graphical interface to easily configure and enable the necessary peripherals.

3. **Clock Configuration**: Set up the clock tree configuration to ensure the correct timing and frequency for the microcontroller's operation.

4. **Pinout Configuration**: Assign and configure the pins for the various peripherals. STM32CubeMX automatically handles pin assignment based on your selections.

5. **Code Generation Settings**: Navigate to the "Project" settings tab and configure the project name, toolchain (e.g., STM32CubeIDE), and code generation options.

6. **Generate Code**: Click the "Generate Code" button to generate the initialization code and project files. 
STM32CubeMX will create the project structure with the appropriate code files and configurations.

### Code Generation

1. **STM32CubeIDE**: Open the generated project in STM32CubeIDE or another compatible IDE. 
STM32CubeIDE integrates with STM32CubeMX to support code generation and peripheral configuration.

2. **Initialization Code**: The generated code includes initialization routines for all configured peripherals and clock settings. Review the `main.c`, `stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h`, 
and other generated files to understand the initialization process.

3. **Custom Code**: Add your application-specific code in the designated sections. 
The code generation process keeps the initialization code separate from your application code, 
allowing you to modify your application logic without affecting the generated initialization code.

4. **Build and Debug**: Use STM32CubeIDE to build, flash, and debug your application. The IDE provides a comprehensive development environment with debugging tools and utilities.

## Directory Structure

- **Core**: Contains the main application code and HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers.
- **Drivers**: Includes peripheral drivers generated by STM32CubeMX.
- **Inc**: Header files, including configuration headers and initialization files.
- **Src**: Source files, including initialization code and user application code.
- **Middlewares**: Contains any middleware components configured in STM32CubeMX.

## Notes

- **Configuration Changes**: If you need to make changes to peripheral configurations, re-open the project in STM32CubeMX, modify the settings, and regenerate the code. 
Ensure that you do not overwrite your custom application code.
- **Documentation**: Refer to STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE documentation for detailed information on using these tools.

## Conclusion

This project leverages STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE for efficient development and configuration of STM32 microcontroller-based systems. 
The generated code provides a solid foundation for your application, while allowing flexibility for customization and expansion.
