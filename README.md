# Digital Clock and Alarm
## Description
This project is done using STM32F401cc microcontroller to make a digital clock that displays time on LM020L LCD and has an alarm system.\
The project is simulated on Proteus. \
The project depends on STM32 drivers generated by STM32Cube and focuses on configuring the drivers to work as needed and implementing the required hardware drivers
and the clock application itself.

## Main Features
### the Digital clock contatins two software modules : Clock and Alaram
![Clock](https://github.com/Ziad-Elshrief/DigitalClock_Alarm/blob/main/Simulation%20snippets/Clock.JPG) \
The Clock provides the following functions:
* **Displaying time:** displays time in 24 hours format in hours, minutes and seconds.
 ```C
/**
 * @brief updates the display of the current time on the LCD
 * 		 gets called every 1 second if G_u8DisaplayFlag ==1
 * 
 * @param hr hours to be displayed from Clock_updateTime()
 * @param min minutes to be displayed from Clock_updateTime()
 * @param sec seconds to be displayed from Clock_updateTime()
 */
void Clock_display(u8 hr , u8 min , u8 sec);
  ```
* **Setting time:** using set Clock button you can set the current hour and minute then press set clock again
``` C
/**
 * @brief Setting clock mode gets called by pressing set Clock button
 * sets the clock using 6 buttons
 * up 			:to increment the value indicated by the cursor on the LCD
 * down 		:to decrement the value indicated by the cursor on the LCD
 * right 		:to move the cursor to the right 
 * left			:to move the cursor to the left
 * cancel 		:to cancel setting the clock and redisplay the clock
 * set clock 	:to set the global time variables and display the updated time 
 */
void Clock_setClock();
```
* **Updating time:** that gets called every second by systick or whatever time source that can be used
``` c
  /**
 * @brief updates the display of the current time on the LCD
 * 		 gets called every 1 second if G_u8DisaplayFlag ==1
 * 
 * @param hr hours to be displayed from Clock_updateTime()
 * @param min minutes to be displayed from Clock_updateTime()
 * @param sec seconds to be displayed from Clock_updateTime()
 */
void Clock_display(u8 hr , u8 min , u8 sec);
```
* **Comapring Time:** to be used by the alarm system
``` C
/**
 * @brief compare hours and minutes to current time 
 * 
 * @param A_u8Hours :hours to be compared
 * @param A_u8Mins 	:minutes to be compared
 * @return u8 : true or false
 */
u8 Clock_compareTime(u8 A_u8Hours,u8 A_u8Mins);
```

The Alarm provides the following functions:
* **Setting alarm:** using set Alarm button you can set the current hour and minute then press set alarm again
``` C
/**
 * @brief Setting alarm mode gets called by pressing set Alarm button
 * sets the alarm using 6 buttons
 * up 			:to increment the value indicated by the cursor on the LCD
 * down 		:to decrement the value indicated by the cursor on the LCD
 * right 		:to move the cursor to the right
 * left			:to move the cursor to the left
 * cancel 		:to cancel setting the alarm and redisplay the clock
 * set alarm 	:to set the global alarm variables and redisplay the clock
 */
void Alaram_setAlarm();
```
* **Enable/Disable alarm:** using Alarm ON/OFF button to trun on or off the alarm
* ** Snooze:** if the alarm is ringing it can be snoozed for 5 minutes

### As for the hardware:
* **STM32F401cc** which serves as the main component in the system that controls the clock and the alarm
* **LM020L** the LCD module which is used to display the 24 hours format
* **Buzzer** the alarm sound
* **LED** which indicates that the alarm is on
* **10 Push Buttons** which interacts with the alarm or the clock
  **Alarm Buttons:** Snooze, set Alarm, Alarm ON/OFF and Stop Alarm
  **Clock Buttons:** set Clock
  **Geneal Buttons:** Up, Down< Right, Left and cancel
  which works in both set clock and alarm modes
